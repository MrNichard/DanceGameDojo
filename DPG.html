    <h1>Welcome to the dance pad guide</h1>
    <p>Here I'll take you through the various kinds and types of dance pads,
    and provide the needed information about them. If you'd like a more detailed explanation of the various types
    of pads, please check out this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3uaWqtmVwg" target="_blank">Dom_ITG</a> 
    or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3uaWqtmVwg" target="_blank">Dance Pad Guide</a> on R/DanceDanceRevolution</p>

        <center><h2>Arcade Pads</h2></center>
    <p>Arcade pads are the real deal. These pads were made for the public arcade enviornment, so they were built to last. 
    Doesn't matter if it's from an ITG, DDR, or PIU cab. That said, the quality you get/find them in may vary. They may have dead sensors,
    dim/dead lights, or panels covered in rust. Thankfully, sites like <a href="https://www.mysticsteps.com/" target="_blank">Mysticsteps</a>
    and <a href="https://ddrpad.com/" target="_blank">DDRpad.com</a> sell parts so you can fix up and even upgrade your dancepad. 
    Pricing also varies, but they are usually around the $400-$1000 mark (depending on the pad type and quality). 
    I myself own an Arcade pad (1st gen DDR JCab pad), and can say that it has held up well.</p>

        <center><h2>Stepmaniax</h2></center>
        <p>Stepmaniax pads are arcade pads you can buy brand new. They're made by Kyle Ward, the same person who helped to create the 
        In The Groove series of Dance Games. Instead of arcade sensors, these pads use FSR's.</p>

        <center><h2>L-tek</h2></center>
        <p>L-Tek pads are essentially the modern day Cobalt Fluxes. I used one of these for around 3 months, and can say 
        that it's pretty good. </p>

        <p>This company went defunct back in 2020, so you're not going to find them new anymore. The pads are essentially two pieces
        of wood seperated by foam spacers, with a foil like contact sensor. </p>
