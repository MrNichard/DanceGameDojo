    <h1>Welcome to the dance pad guide</h1>
    <p>Here I'll take you through the various kinds and types of dance pads,
    and provide the needed information about them. If you'd like a more detailed explanation of the various types
    of pads, please check out this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3uaWqtmVwg" target="_blank">Dom_ITG</a>

    <h2>Arcade Pads</h2>
    <p>Arcade pads are the real deal. These pads were made for the public arcade enviornment, so they were built to last. 
    Doesn't matter if it's from an ITG, DDR, or PIU cab. That said, the quality you get/find them in may vary. They may have dead sensors,
    dim/dead lights, or panels covered in rust. Thankfully, sites like <a href="https://www.mysticsteps.com/" target="_blank">Mysticsteps</a>
    and <a href="https://ddrpad.com/" target="_blank">DDRpad.com</a> sell parts so you can fix up and even upgrade your dancepad. 
    Pricing also varies, but they are usually around the $400-$1000 mark (depending on the pad type and quality). 
    I myself own an Arcade pad (1st gen DDR JCab pad), and can say that it has held up well.</p>

    <h2>Stepmaniax</h2>
    <p>Stepmaniax pads are arcade pads you can buy brand new. They're made by Kyle Ward, the same person who helped to create the 
        In The Groove series of Dance Games. Instead of arcade sensors, these pads use FSR's. However what sensor you find in the pad
        depends on what generation of pad  you buy. Gen 1-3 uses load cells, while Gen 4-5 uses FSR's. These pads are fairly pricey, adding up 
        to nearly $2000 after shipping costs. There have been issues with the pad recalibrating during play, but there are easy fixes for that. 
        Then there is the fact that these pads are so sought after that when they drop, they sell out in SECONDS.
        No kidding, entire shipments have been soldout within 30 seconds or less. If you do want to try and get your hands on an SMX stage, you can find them on
        <a href="https://stepmaniax.com/" target="_blank">Stepmaniax' official website.</a></p>

    <h2>L-tek</h2>
    <h3>L-Tek pads are essentially the modern day Cobalt Fluxes. I used one of these for around 3 months, and can say 
        that it was pretty good. These pads use a metal contact sensor, much like older hard/metal pads. These pads work fairly well, however are prone to pad
        faults when playing higher level songs. Thankfully these pads are easy to mod, so you can perform what is called the penny mod 
        on them to increase the sensitivity. This pad also gives you the option to buy an optional bar to come with it. I've heard that the bar is in a different spot
        from something like a DDR or ITG bar, and that it does wobble quite I bit. It's said L-Tek had recently fixed this issue though. Both the DDR & PIU style pads retail for 
        $250, with shipping to the U.S being around $100. If you'd like to pick one up, they're constantly avaliable on <a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/" target="_blank">L-teks website.</a></h3>

    <h2>Cobalt Flux</h2>
    <h3>Cobalt Flux are one of the most well known home pads throughout the history of DDR. Despite most of them being 10 years old or older
    (the company stopped making the pads in 2011/2012), many players still use this as they're primary dance pad. These pads we're and are known for there
    build quality, which is why a lot of them are still going strong decades after they left the manufacturor. These pads also uses metal contacts, so you can also
    penny mod these to increase there sensitivity. You do need to be careful when modding though, as there is a thin wire attached to the pad that could potentially snap,
    if you aren't careful. I own two of these, and still uses them for when I want to play DDR on the PS2 or Xbox. The ones I bought were sitting in a ladys garage for years,
    and still worked like new when I plugged them into my PS2. Just goes to show how well they were made. Usually you can get one of these for $100 to $400 at most.</h3>

    <h2>Blueshark</h2>
    <p>This pad is unique to the other home pads of its kind, because this one uses actual acrade sensors. It has sensors in to the style akin to a DDR Solo's pad,
    with two sensors near the center of the pad under each of the arrow panels. Like the Cobalt Flux, these have been out of production for years at this point; So you're 
    only going to find these on the second hand market nowadays. The pads are also quite hard to find, and very uncommon to come across. Usually they go for between $250 to maybe $400.</p>
