    <h1>Welcome to the Dance Pad Guide</h1>
    <p>Here I'll take you through the various kinds and types of dance pads,
    and provide the needed information about them. If you'd like a more detailed explanation of the various types
    of pads, please check out this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEWj2_BNG_0" target="_blank">Dom_ITG</a>

    <center><h2>Arcade Pads</h2></center>
    <p>Arcade pads are the real deal. These pads were made for the public arcade enviornment, so they were built to last. 
    Doesn't matter if it's from an ITG, DDR, or PIU cab. That said, the quality you get/find them in may vary. They may have dead sensors,
    dim/dead lights, or panels covered in rust. Thankfully, sites like <a href="https://www.mysticsteps.com/" target="_blank">Mysticsteps</a>
    and <a href="https://ddrpad.com/" target="_blank">DDRpad.com</a> sell parts so you can fix up and even upgrade your dancepad. 
    Pricing also varies, but they are usually around the $400-$1000 mark (depending on the pad type and quality). 
    I myself own an Arcade pad (1st gen DDR JCab pad), and can say that it has held up well.</p>

    <center><h2>Stepmaniax</h2></center>
    <p>Stepmaniax pads are arcade pads you can buy brand new. They're made by Kyle Ward, the same person who helped to create the 
        In The Groove series. Instead of arcade sensors, these pads use FSR's. However what sensor you find in the pad
        depends on what generation of pad  you buy. Gen 1-3 uses load cells, while Gen 4-5 uses FSR's. These pads are fairly pricey, adding up 
        to nearly $2000 after shipping costs. There have been issues with the pad recalibrating during play, but there are easy fixes for that. 
        Then there is the fact that these pads are so sought after that when they drop, they sell out in SECONDS.
        No kidding, entire shipments have been soldout within 30 seconds or less. If you do want to try and get your hands on an SMX stage, you can find them on
        <a href="https://stepmaniax.com/" target="_blank">Stepmaniax' official website.</a></p>

    <center><h2>L-tek</h2></center>
    <p>L-Tek pads are essentially the modern day Cobalt Fluxes. I used one of these for around 3 months, and can say 
        that it was pretty good. These pads use a metal contact sensor, much like older hard/metal pads. These pads work fairly well, however are prone to pad
        faults when playing higher level songs. Thankfully these pads are easy to mod, so you can perform what is called the penny mod 
        on them to increase the sensitivity. This pad also gives you the option to buy an optional bar to come with it. I've heard that the bar is in a different spot
        from something like a DDR or ITG bar, and that it does wobble quite I bit. It's said L-Tek had recently fixed this issue though. Both the DDR & PIU style pads retail for 
        $250, with shipping to the U.S being around $100. If you'd like to pick one up, they're constantly avaliable on <a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/" target="_blank">L-teks website.</a></p>

    <center><h2>Cobalt Flux</h2></center>
    <p>Cobalt Flux are one of the most well known home pads throughout the history of DDR. Despite most of them being 10 years old or older
    (the company stopped making the pads in 2011/2012), many players still use this as they're primary dance pad. These pads we're and are known for there
    build quality, which is why a lot of them are still going strong decades after they left the manufacturor. These pads also uses metal contacts, so you can also
    penny mod these to increase there sensitivity. You do need to be careful when modding though, as there is a thin wire attached to the pad that could potentially snap,
    if you aren't careful. I own two of these, and still use them for when I want to play DDR on the PS2 or Xbox. The ones I bought were sitting in a ladys garage for years,
    and still worked like new when I plugged them into my PS2. Just goes to show how well they were made. Usually you can get one of these for $100 to $400 at most.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-2">
    <center><h2>Blueshark</h2></center>
    <p>This pad is unique to the other home pads of its kind, because this one uses actual acrade sensors. It has sensors akin to a DDR Solo's pad,
    with two sensors near the center of the pad under each of the arrow panels. The pads also came with the option of a bar, but you won't always find a blueshark with that option. 
    Like the Cobalt Flux, these have been out of production for years at this point; So you're 
    only going to find these on the second hand market nowadays. The pads are also quite hard to find, and very uncommon to come across. Usually they go for between $250 to maybe $400.</p>

    <center><h2>Baila Tech</h2></center>
    <p>I'll be frank in saying Baila Tech does not have the best reputation, and this isn't undeserved. There reputation was already soured when they constantly spammed the buy and sell groups with ads.
    When people did buy pads from them, most of them didn't even recieve it! To this day, there are still customer who have not recieved there pad; with one still not recieving one two years after they placed the order.
    The company also falsly advertises it's product. They say that there pads use fsrs, but seller have said the sensor are more alike to metal contacts. One customer who actually recived a pad, had to extensively mod it 
    to make it work to there liking. This required him completely replacing the circuit board, as well as a few other modifications. If you like to see his journey with the pad, he posted his story on reddit. These pad range from 
    $350, to $525. Given there quality issues, and taking shipping from Argentina into account, I wouldn't recommend getting one of these. </p>

        <center><h2>DanceFit</h2></center>
        <p>These are made by a small company in Brazil, with a build style similar to Baila Tech. However unlike Baila tech, the people who have 
        bought these pads have actually recieved them. These pads also use Metal contacts, however thre placement uses the layout of an arcade pads (one sensors on each 
        corner). If you would like to upgrade the sensors to FSR's, the process is doable. If you would like to pick one up, they are avaliable on <a href="https://dancefitgaming.com.br/" target="_blank">Dancefits website.</a></p>

    <div class="col-2">
        <center><h2>Legacy Hard Pads</h2></center>
        <p>Legacy hard pads are any generic hard/metal pad. These include pads like the DDRGame Ion, TX-2500, and DDRGame champion. Usually these pads use the same design,
        but are sold by different companies (however the most well known is DDRGame). These are the most common metal pad you'll find, however the quality is something to be desired.
        The metal contact sensors dying is common with these pads, and the build quality on them often varies. These can be modded, but it does take some work. If you find one of these for cheap 
        and are a more casual player, then these would probably work for you. They go for between $50-$300 from what I have seen. Most of these aren't manufactored anymore aswell, but DDRGame may still make a 
        few of there models as of 2023.</p>

        <center><h2>Precision Dance Pads</h2></center>
        <p>This company went defunct back in 2020, so you're not going to find them new anymore. The pads are essentially two pieces
        of wood seperated by foam spacers, with a foil like contact sensor. If you plan on modding one of these, then your in for a challenge.
        Due to the pads construction, it is incredibely hard to modify these pads. The sensors are known to get stuck, or downright fail completely.
        The upside of having a pad like this is that its easy to store, since these only weigh around 9 lbs/4 kg. These pads also had a variety of customization
        options, so that was pretty cool. </p>

        <center><h2>Travel Pad</h2></center>
        <p>Travel pads are what the name says, a pad that is small enough to bring on your travels. While there aren't any real manuafactors of them (beside one or two people who sell them in batches on facebook),
        there are plenty of guides online that can show you how to make one. All you really need are some FSR's, an Arduino, a Breadboard, and something to put it all on, you'll have a travel pad
        in no time! Now the design in mind is made for stamina play, but it doesn't mean you can't do other playstyles on it. The cost varies on what materials you use, the end result is usually the same. </p>

    <div class="col-2">
        <center><h2>Softpads</h2></center>
        <p>Softpads are the most common form of DDR pad you'll find. Like the generic hardpads, there were tons of companies that made there own version of these.
        There's two versions of the softpad; the standard one, and one that had foam blocks between the top and bottom. While both are essentially the same, the foam one
        actually has grooves where you can feel the contact sensors. These things are dirt cheap, usually between $5-$20; and you can find these just about anywhere. These are recommended for beginners only, 
        but there are people that have gotten some really impressive scores using a softpad.</p>
