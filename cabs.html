    <button type="button" class="collapsible">First Generation</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Generation 1 cabs were produced from the release of 1st mix (1998) thru the release of Supernova 2 (2007). They have a
29" CRT display outputting 240p/480i, and a marquee held on top of the machine by two legs. Over the 9 years there were a few different
iterations of these, which include...</p>
<p><li>J-Cabs: These were built with the Japanese market in mind, and were shipped out from 1st mix (1998) to Extreme (2002). They have a black
outer shell, a single coin slot, and sometimes two PS1 memory card slots for you to bring over your edits from the console games. Versions of these
without the memory card readers made eventually made there way over to the U.S.</li></p>

<center><p>(A DDR Extreme J-Cab)</p></center>
<p><li>K-Cabs: These cabs were assembled in Korea, and begun shipping out with DDR 3rd mix. The differences include the cab having two coins slots,
the button panel being made of only one piece of metal, and the cab being made of mdf instead of plywood. Then there is also the fact that there
sometimes the wires lack proper grounding and the monitor is secured by wood blocks instead of metal brackets, which is why some people consider them inferior.</li></p>

<center><p>(A DDR Extreme K-Cab)</p></center>
<p><li>EU Cabs: While very close in appearance to J-Cabs, these cabs to use different parts. These include screws, neons, wiring, speakers either being made 
with higher quality material, or outright being incompatible with each other. They also come with a 220v to 110v step-down transformer. The black varient
of these cabs were shipped out from Dancing Stage (1999) through Euromix 2 (2002), and the gray models shipped out from Fusion (2005) to Supernova (2006).</li></p>

<center><p>(A DS Euromix 2 EU-Cab)</p></center>
<p><li>Betson Cabs: Betson cabinets were assembled in America and shipped out by Betson. These can be identified by the cabinet having a flat marquee instead of 
a curved one. The cabinets themself also have slightly less depth. These cabinets also have better wiring, as well as a better screen (Kortek multi-sync). Both these
and red cabs used EXT-IO boards instead of a PCB to handle panel/neon lighting. These shipped out from Supernova (2006) to Supernova 2 (2007).</li></p>
<p><li>Red Cabs: This type of cabinet is very hard to find outside of Japan. There entire sides and front are red, and they begun shipping out with Supernova in 2006.
There CRTS are also better; being more flat and flush, and outputting 480p instead of 240p/480i. Besides that there aren't many differences.</li></p>
<p><li>Namco Crapo Cabs: Namco Crapo Cabs are kind of a mystery of where they came from. The story that most people have come to agree upon is that Namco wanted to add
DDR to there arcades, and purchased a bunch of cabinets (several hundred) from somewhere outside the U.S. However they fell victim to a bait & switch (shown something, then
got something entirely different), and the cabinets they recieved were total crap. Instead of using PCB's, these cabs used hacked PS2's and ran the U.S PS2 version of DDR Extreme.
The pads weren't much better either, with the quality being that of a cheap home metal pad; and used metal contact sensors like in said homepad. Some of the Namco technicians
actually fixed up some the cabs; adding in actual arcade sensors and replacing the PS2's with ITG 2 BoXoRs. You can tell these cabs apart by there 
Bright blue & red arrow panels, and the text on the bezel saying "Here We Come" instead of "Here We Go!"</li></p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Second Generation</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Generation 2 cabs were produced from the release of DDR X (2008) thru the release of DDR X3 vs 2nd Mix (2011). They have a 37" 720p LCD screen,
  and come with E-Amuse readers integrated into the machine. There are two version of this cab type, which include..</p>
  <p>Japanese variant: The Japanese version of the HD cab has silver and black buttons, seperate metal panels, and light spires on each side of the machine. Like older versions, the cabinets use a Jamma board.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Third Generation</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Generation 3 cabs began shipping out with DDR 2013 in 2013, and only recently been taken out of production after A20 plus got its final update in
  2021. These cabinets have a 42" 1080p LCD screen. Unlike previous iterations, these cabinets don't have panel lights; and a white cab will either come 
  from Japan, Korea, or Taiwan (though the end result of construction is the same). If you're looking to play on one, you'll find them mainly in Dave & Busters
  and Round 1; although quite a number of them have begun making there way into smaller mom & pop arcades.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Fourth Generation</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Generation 4 cabs made there way to the arcades in 2019 for DDRs 20th Anniversary, and are still (slowly) finding there way into arcades; but those arcades 
  are exclusivly Round 1's to my knowledge. They have a 55" 1080p LCD screen, and share a similar contruction build to Dancerush cabinets. </p>
