    <h2>5 Panel</h2>
    <p>Games that have a layout using 5 arrow panels</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">PIU</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Hitting the arcade floors a year after DDR became avaliable, PIU is a 5 panel dance game made by Korean Company Andamiro. Besides the panel layout being very different
  from DDR, the song selection also has a noticeable change; having a good chunk of the song list being K-pop or Korean oriented songs.</p>

  <p>This is what a modern PIU cabinet looks like.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Stepmaniax</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Stepmaniax is the newest dance game on the market, and is quickly becoming more common as new machines find there way into arcades. SMX uses the same arrow layout as DDR
  and ITG, only with the center panel also being active. </p>

    <h2>6 panel</h2>
    <p>Games that have a layout using 6 arrow panels</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">DDR Solo</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>DDR Solo is unique, as it is (to my knowledge) the only dance game to use 6 panels during gameplay. This version of DDR was only made between 1999 and 2000, and is not the most common version of the game you'll find. </p>

    <h2>9 Panel</h2>
    <p>Games that have a layout using 9 arrow panels</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Rhythm Horizon</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Rhythm Horizon is an up and coming 9 panel dance game, created by veteran players Matt (Mad Matt/Sigatrev) & Lara (Hurtpiggypig). It is still in Beta at the moment, however you can 
  actually purchase said beta for a monthly fee. To go along with this game, they are creating there own pad that uses FSR's.
  Unfortunately, like the full game, it's far from being finished.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Technomotion</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Technomotion was a short lived 9 panel game created by the Korean company F2 systems. The pads were in the style of DDR, but there is an arrow panel on 
  each section of the pad. The cabinet itself looks to be a modified design of a DDR cabinet, but I cannot tell for sure. The game allowed you to pick a 4, 5, or 8 panel mode.</p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>Games using other types of arrow panel layouts</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">EZ2 Dancer</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Ez2dancer was made by Korean Company Amuseworld between 2000 and 2004. The game is unique, as it uses both hand and foot sensors.
  It uses 3 foot sensors (in a kinda oval shape), and two infrared hand sensors. It is a rarity to find one of these nowadays, as 
  the only really known cabinets were in Chile, the U.K, the Phillipines, and Korea.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Dancerush</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>While it may not look like it has panels, the whole platform is essentially one big panel. During gameplay there is 4 visible markers on the screen,
  and you need to shuffle your feet across the platform to hit the notes that come down said markers.</p>
