        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">DDR Storm</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>DDR STORM began in the year 2001 as a small DDR and fighting game tournament in Florida. Over the years, they expanded to adding in games like PIU & ITG. For the past 2 decades, the
  tournament has always been held in the South Florida. While not exactly in the same place, the most common location for it has been Daytona Beach. Currently the next DDR storm is set to 
  happen from June 23rd to the 25th. This is coming off of a 3 year hiatus due to a certain pandemic. </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rocky Mount</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>RMT began in the early 2000's as a DDR tournament held in North Carolina, held at Putt Indoor Mini Golf & Games until the arcade closed down. From there it was held at a
  nearby Hilton hotel until 2015, where the tournaments appeared to go on an indefinate hiatus. The events featured tournaments for DDR, ITG, and until 2008,
  ITG couples.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rumble In The Prarie</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>R.I.P has been held at the University of Illinois since 2010, holding tournaments for FA/Tech charts as well as Mod Charts. It was started in 2010 by the universities rhythm game club,
  and has since grown into one of the largest dance game tournaments in the country.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">ITG Euro/World Cup</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Held in a few places across Europe, the ITG Eurocup was a tournament in which players from all across Europe would come together to compete. Starting as the World Cup in 2006,
  it would then become the Eurocup in 2008, being held at Silverstone in the Netherlands until 2010.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">D.O.W.N.S & U.P.S</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>D.O.W.N.S, U.P.S, and now R.I.G.H.T.S are a series of tournaments focuses primarily around mod charts. The first one was held at Tropical Fun Zone, where it then
  moved to Harrisburg FFC, and then to Penn State. </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Champions of the Coast</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Starting in 2007 as Kings of the coast, Champions of the coast has been held at 8 on the break in Dunellen, NJ on a yearly bases. Since 2007, its been held exclusively
  at the 8 on the break arcade. The tournaments consisted of almost exclusively Dance/Rhythm games, with a minor focus in fighting games (like Street Fighter & Smash Bros).
  However unlike normal tournaments, COTC has a tournament centered around 8otb's signature food item, the breaksteak. Did I mention 8otb has an inhouse kitchen?
  Bascially its your standard eating contest, where a contestant has to eat an entire breaksteak special in as little time as possible. Unfortunately all he tournaments 
  have been put on hiatus since the covid pandemic hit, but there are hope that it will be making a comeback.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">ECS & ECFA</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The East Coast series has been around since the early 2010's, with ECS being the only one to be fully in person at one point. As the names would suggest, ECS is focused
  on Stamina, while ECFA is focuses on Foot Accuracy. In recent times ECFA has gone under a new name, ITL, and will continue to go by this in the near future. ECFA has been 
  almost exclusively an online tournament, however ECS is completely different. Until 2020, ECS was always held in person at the Harrisburg FFC. This was the case for both the
  mainline and .5 events. In 2019, the ECS team setup StaminaCon. This was held at the Best Western Plus Hotel & Conference Center in Baltimore Maryland. Since 2020, both
  tournament series have gone online due to the pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Game History</h2>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Dance Dance Revolution</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Hitting the Japanese arcades in 1998, and proceeded to take the world by storm. Beginning with DDR 1st mix, more began to trickle in over the 
  next few years, until in 2002 released DDR Extreme. After that, the series went on Hiatus until 2006 with the release of Supernova. After that, 
  Konami began to start releasing new Versions on a fairly regular basis. Currently the lastes version of the game is A3. If you want to play it though, you're 
  going to have to find a Gold cab.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">In The Groove</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>After Dance Dance Revolution went into hiatus in 2002, 3 men came up with the idea to create there own spin on the game. Kyle Ward, Chris Foy, and Chris Danford (all former Microsoft employees), 
  created the first version of the game in 2003, which ran off of an build of an early version of Stepmania. They then got permission to test the game at a local arcade, using there 
  DDR disney rave cabinet as the testing cabinet. After a few months of testing, the team finally introduced the world to ITG at IAAPA Oralando 2003. After that they began working on the final product. It was shown off at a few more trade show, before
  it was released to the public on August 30th, 2004 in the form of an upgrade kit for DDR cabinets. While it did gain some popularity amongst the community, it really took off with the release of In The Groove 2. That was released on 
  June 18th, 2005, and this time it came with its own dedicated cabinet made by Andamiro (the makers of Pump It Up). With this the game became more accesible in arcades, and players would flock to the 
  nearest dedicab to check it out. After this, there were even plans for a third game in the series. That though, was short lived. In 2006, Konami sued RoXoR on patent infringement for there design of DDR.
  To make a long story short, they won, and RoXoR was made to stop production of In The Groove immediately. They did, but not before releasing a patch that allowed players to add ther own custom songs onto the machines.
  And the rest they say, is history.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pump It Up</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Released roughly a year after Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up released to the public in late 1999. Created by the Korean arcade game manufacturer Andamiro, Pump It Up (or PIU for short) brought with it 
  a new spin to the machine dance scene. Although the arrow panel layout is different from DDR, opting for a 5 panel layout, PIU's core gameplay is very similar to its Japanese counterpart. Unlike DDR, PIU actually 
  had to options for modifiers to increase of decrease the note speed (DDR didn't have this option until 6th mix in 2001). In 2001 Konami sued Andamiro for patent infringement on there product, much like they did to 
  Roxor in 2006. However unlike what happened with Roxor, Andamiro actually won the lawsuit. After that, Andamiro would begin to further expand the PIU empire; making the game just as common (if not more common) than DDR.
  With talks of Andamiro discontinuing the PIU franchise, you're gonna have to admit that this game has had one hell of a legacy in it's 20+ year time period.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Stepmaniax</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Meet the new kid on the block. Being introduced to the public in 2017, Stepmaniax is the creation of former In The Groove developer and creator Kyle Ward. From its inception, the game was meant to be a sort of 
  spiritual succesor to the In The Groove series of Dance Games; with the games name being a nod to the open source game Stepmania, as many of the people who worked on Stepmania back in the day are now working on StepManiaX.
  The style of the game remains faithful to its predecessor, as is uses a 4 panel layout with the addition of a center panel. Since 2017, StepManiaX has been finding it's way into more and more arcade each day. Not just 
  smaller non chain/franchise arcades, but trampolines parks, YMCA's, and even some schools. Kyle Ward has stated that one of his goals is to revilalise dance games, and I think it is safe to say that mission is going well. 
  With the new deluxe size cabinet that his company released, I think that goal will continue to be achieved.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Technomotion</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This game is kind of a weird one. What this game is is essentially a DDR and PIU hybrid/Frankensteins monster mish mash. I'm pretty sure the game even nodded to that by having both games logos at the bottom of the marquee.
  This game was made by the Korean Arcade Company F2 systems in 2000, and only two versions were released before the game was discontinued. F2 systems doesn't even acknowledge the game anymore, apart from a single image they have of
  it on one of the pages of there website. Technomotion is unique, as it is the only 9 panel game to be released in arcade. It has 3 modes, 4, 5, and 8 panel mode; and you could actually switch between these modes by pressing a 
  small button on the machine. Fun fact, this game is the direct inspiration for the game Rhythm Horizon, but we'll talk more about that soon.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rhythm Horizon</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Rhythm Horizon was created back in 2015 as an idea by Matt (MadMatt) and Lara (hurtpiggypig), and was directly inspired by the game technomotion. There isn't going to be a dedicated arcade cabinet, but there will be a dedicated 
  dance pad. The game itself is still in the beta stages, and doesn't look like it's gonna be finished anytime soon. You can actually play the beta by downloading it off the website, however you'll have to pay $5 a month to be able to 
  play it. I do hope the game does end of succeding, as there are not many (if not none at all) 9 panel dance games in existence anymore, let alone one that is made by a team of veteran dance game players.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Ez2Dancer</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Also created by a Korean company (Amuseworld), Ez2Dancer was a short lived 3 panel dance game from the early 2000's. Between 2000 and 2004, Amuseworld released a few different versions of the game to the public. These included 1st 
  & 2nd move, UK Move, UKMove Special Edition, and SuperChina. What sets this game apart from the others is not only is it the only 3 panel game, it also uses 2 infared hand sensors to add a little extra challenge to the game. While the 
  game was very popular in the territories it was released in (China, Korea, the U.K the Phillipines, and weirdly enough Chile), it didn't seem to make it's way to any other countries besides the one mentioned.</p>

        <h2>Playstyles</h2>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">FA/Tech</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>What I think is the oldest playstyle to exist, the FA playstyle is the primarly based on accuracy and achieving the highest score possible for whichever game you are playing. As the years went on, the charts meant for this playstyle
  began to get amped up as the meta slowly began to change. Harder gimmicks began to be placed into the charts. No longer was it just crossovers and jumps, now you had things like footswitches, brackets, and rhythms.
  As players began to get ahold of these technical trials, they began using them in combination to great harder and more technical charts. Some which (at the time), proved to be a challenge even for top players. 
  As for modern day tech, the technical aspects are still alive and kicking (although much more refined). Some great examples of this are the newer ITG tech packs that have come out in recent years, including the Guys series, Bemanibeats, and Bangers Only.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Stamina</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Stamina began taking its form around the late 2000's when In The Groove's R21 patch begun to make its way onto machines. What R21 allowed was for users to add custom songs that were over 3 minutes onto machines, and users took advantage of
  this by creating there own charts to there own music. Most of these charts contained sections of notes that followed in a constant stream for numerous measures at a time. While it wasn't officially deemed, the concept was there. It wasn't until
  2009/2010 where the first real Stamina focused pack (either Dragonforce or Archi's Disbalanced, I think). As player began to start passing the higher level charts in the packs, more and more of them began making there way on to forums and websites.
  Even now, players are still making charts as high as 37. While only a few players are able to pass charts like this, its still shows us how incredible it is that people are now able to pass songs like these.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Mod Charts</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Mod charts have been around since the very beginning of ITG. While you could do some stuff with the original DDR games, it wasn't nearly as impressive as some of the things ITG 1 & 2 could do.
  While you could add that stuff into the base game, the mod courses were what they were really known for. Once ITG shifted over to the community, that is where they really began tp tale off. Players like
  Windeu & Spootybiscuit were some of the first to bring these to light in the community. Over time, they began to find there ways into tournaments like Rumble In The Prarie, and eventually got there own
  categories in said tournaments. Since then, mod charts have begun to get more recognition by the community and the public (being featured in last years GDQ).</p>
