    <center><h2>A bit about the site</h2></center>
    <p>Since June of 2020 I have been an avid Dance Game enthusiast, and I find myself constantly looking 
        up more and more info on the games I play. I decided to make a hotspot for for all information regarding dance games.</p>
        <p>Dance Games are one of my biggest passions, and the same can be said for a lot of other people. My goal is to create a 
        sight where players of all ages and skill levels can come together. Whether your a tech, stamina, mod chart, or casual player,
        there is going to be something here for everyone.</p>
        <p>My goal for this site is to provide the player base with as much information as possible. This includes information on the games
        history, the various type/versions of those game, on there playstyle, and even give some useful tips to help new players
        improve.</p>
